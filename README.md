<h1 align="center">Hey 👋What's Up?</h1>

##About Me
I'm a Computer Science student that love building applications that make a real-life impact.
I mix engineering, entrepreneurship, and execution to turn ideas into products people actually use and also benefit me.
I focus on creating tools, apps, and systems that improve daily life, whether that’s automating parts of my sneaker business, or building AI-powered tools that react in real time.
